  <h2>Cities I have lived</h2>
  <p>I was born in Albany and as my family changed jobs we moved further south. The last two cities are where I have
    been stationed.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Albany, NY</li>
    <li>Norfolk, VA</li>
    <li>Orlando, FL</li>
    <li>Wichita, KS</li>
    <li>Vacaville, CA</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Cities I want to visit</h2>
  <p>I have never been to Australia and I think it would be interesting even though it seems like everything wants to
    kill you. I would like to go to Norway because I have always been fascinated with Vikings. And Venice because it
    seems like a nice place.
